The average error across all the folds is then calculated for each value of lambda, and the value of lambda that minimizes the error is selected.\n",

Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, which can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients in ordinary least squares regression.\n",

    "In Ridge Regression, the regularization term adds a penalty to the sum of squared coefficients, which helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of correlated variables towards zero. This reduces the variance in the estimates and leads to more stable and reliable predictions.\n",

    "In fact, Ridge Regression can even improve the performance of the model in the presence of multicollinearity, as it can effectively trade-off bias and variance in the estimates. By reducing the variance, Ridge Regression can help to reduce the risk of overfitting, which can be particularly problematic when multicollinearity is present."

The window size can be optimized using cross-validation techniques.\n",
