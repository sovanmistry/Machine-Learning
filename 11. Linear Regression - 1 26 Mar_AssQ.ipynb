    "\n",
    "    In general, polynomial regression is preferred over linear regression when the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is non-linear. However, it is important to choose the degree of the polynomial carefully to avoid overfitting. A good approach is to try different degrees of the polynomial and evaluate the performance of the model using cross-validation. In addition, polynomial regression should be used with caution when extrapolating beyond the range of the data."
