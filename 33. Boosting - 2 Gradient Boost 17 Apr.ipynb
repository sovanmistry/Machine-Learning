    "Q1. What is Gradient Boosting Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Gradient Boosting Regression is a popular machine learning technique that combines multiple weak prediction models to create a strong prediction model. It is an extension of the boosting algorithm, where each weak learner is trained on the residual errors of the previous learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Gradient Boosting Regression, the algorithm starts by building an initial prediction model, such as a decision tree, which is often referred to as the base learner. The base learner is trained on the entire dataset and used to make predictions. The residual errors are then calculated by subtracting the predicted values from the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The next step is to train a new base learner on the residual errors. This new base learner is trained to predict the residual errors of the previous learner, and its output is added to the predictions of the previous learner. This process is repeated iteratively, with each new base learner being trained on the residual errors of the previous learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The key idea behind Gradient Boosting Regression is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted values and the actual values. In each iteration, the algorithm tries to find the base learner that minimizes the MSE of the residual errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    One of the benefits of Gradient Boosting Regression is that it is able to handle both continuous and categorical data. It is also less prone to overfitting compared to other algorithms, such as decision trees, because it combines multiple weak learners to create a strong model that generalizes well to new data."

The dataset is taken\\nfrom Fisher\\'s paper. Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n.. topic:: References\\n\\n   - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n     Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n     Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n   - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.

    "    In Gradient Boosting, a weak learner refers to a model that performs only slightly better than random guessing. It is also referred to as a base learner or a weak classifier/regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A weak learner in Gradient Boosting is usually a simple model, such as a decision tree with a small number of nodes or a linear regression model with few features. The idea behind using a weak learner is that, by combining the outputs of many weak learners, we can create a strong predictor that generalizes well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The concept of a weak learner is central to Gradient Boosting, as it is used to build the ensemble of models that make up the final predictor. In each iteration of the algorithm, a new weak learner is trained on the residual errors of the previous weak learners. The output of the weak learner is then combined with the outputs of the previous weak learners to update the predictions.\n",

    "Ans: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The intuition behind Gradient Boosting algorithm is to iteratively add simple models (i.e., weak learners) to the ensemble in a way that they can correct the errors made by the previous models. The main idea is to combine many weak learners to create a strong learner that can make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",

    "    In each subsequent iteration, a new weak learner is trained on the residual errors of the previous model. The weak learner is designed to capture the patterns in the residual errors that the previous model could not capture. The output of the weak learner is then added to the predictions of the previous model to update the overall prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The key idea behind Gradient Boosting is to minimize the loss function (e.g., mean squared error) between the predicted values and the actual values. Each iteration of the algorithm is focused on reducing the loss function by finding the weak learner that best fits the residual errors.\n",
