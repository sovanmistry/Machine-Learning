    "    Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the relationship between conditional probabilities. It is named after the 18th-century English statistician and philosopher, Thomas Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The theorem provides a way to update our belief or degree of uncertainty about a hypothesis or event, based on new evidence or information. It is expressed mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B has occurred.\n",
    "    P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A has occurred.\n",
    "    P(A) is the prior probability of event A.\n",
    "    P(B) is the probability of event B.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Bayes' theorem can be used in a wide range of fields, including statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. For example, it is used in Bayesian inference, which is a method of statistical inference that involves updating probabilities based on new data. It is also used in Bayesian networks, which are graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships between variables.\n"
